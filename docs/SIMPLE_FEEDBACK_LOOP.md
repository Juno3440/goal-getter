# Simple AI Development Feedback Loop

## 🎯 **What You Actually Need**

You already have:
- ✅ Vercel configured (`vercel.json`)
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI/CD
- ✅ Both backend + frontend ready

Just need a **simple human-in-loop process**.

## 🚀 **The 3-Step Process**

### **Step 1: AI Development**
```bash
# AI works on develop branch
git checkout develop
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "ai: implement feature X"
git push origin develop
```

### **Step 2: Vercel Auto-Deploy** 
- **Vercel automatically deploys** `develop` branch
- **Preview URL**: `https://goal-getter-git-develop.vercel.app`
- **Takes ~2 minutes** to build & deploy

### **Step 3: Human Approval**
- User visits preview URL
- Tests the changes  
- Screenshots if needed
- **Comments on GitHub commit**: ✅ Approved or ❌ Needs changes

---

## 📋 **AI Feedback Request Template**

When AI completes work:

```
🤖 **AI Development Complete**

**Changes Made:**
- [List key changes]

**Testing URL:** 
https://goal-getter-git-develop.vercel.app

**Please Review:**
1. Visit the URL above
2. Test the new functionality
3. Take screenshots if needed
4. Reply with ✅ APPROVE or ❌ NEEDS CHANGES

**Expected behavior:**
[Describe what should happen]
```

## 🔧 **Current Issues to Fix First**

Your CI is failing on backend tests, not deployment:

```bash
# Run this to see what's failing:
cd api
uv run pytest -v

# Common fixes:
uv run black .          # Format code
uv run isort .          # Sort imports  
uv run mypy .           # Type checking
```

---

## 💰 **Vercel Costs (Don't Worry)**

**Free Tier Includes:**
- 100GB bandwidth/month
- 1000 build minutes/month  
- Unlimited preview deployments
- Custom domains

**For your use case:** Basically free unless you go viral.

## 🎨 **Optional: Screenshot Automation**

If you want automated screenshots later:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/screenshot.yml
name: Take Screenshots
on:
  deployment_status:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event.deployment_status.state == 'success'
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Screenshot
        run: |
          npx playwright install
          npx playwright screenshot ${{ github.event.deployment_status.target_url }}
```

---

## 🎯 **Why This Works**

1. **Zero setup** - uses existing Vercel + GitHub
2. **Fast iteration** - AI pushes, Vercel deploys in ~2min
3. **Human control** - you test & approve everything
4. **No costs** - Vercel free tier is plenty
5. **Simple** - no complex tools or workflows

---

## 🚀 **Start Now**

1. **Fix CI issues** (run tests locally first)
2. **Push to develop branch** 
3. **Check Vercel deployment**
4. **Use the feedback template above**

That's it! No need for complex MCP servers or paid tools.
