## ðŸš€ Why This App Exists

The objective of this project is to capture all the goals a person can have, and **decrease the time between intention and execution**. Most goal-tracking apps are either glorified todo lists or static structure builders. This project is differentâ€”it leverages AI to:

* Clarify ambiguity about your goals and self
* Actively work on your behalf to progress goals
* Make goal progression scalable, not just trackable

We see this as an operating system for goalsâ€”a **Goal OS**â€”that lives at the intersection of intelligence amplification, personal clarity, and agentic execution.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Philosophy

* **Clarity is leverage**: The faster you can clarify what you want and why, the faster you can act.
* **Agents thrive in structure**: The more structured your goal model, the more useful AI agents become.
* **Interestingness > urgency**: Sometimes the most important goals are the ones that donâ€™t scream at you.
* **Scale should be supported**: You should be able to handle hundreds of goals with clarity, not chaos.
* **UI should evolve with goals**: The nature and feel of the UI may dynamically shift depending on the type of goal being worked on. In the long term, this may involve generated visuals, themes, or even ambient UI elements (like diffusion backgrounds) that reflect the essence of your goals.

## ðŸ§  UX Vision

This isnâ€™t a static listâ€”itâ€™s a living, breathing goal tree.

* Hierarchical goal layout (tree structure)
* Multiple categories ("pains" or "tabs" like Excel sheets) to switch between domains (e.g. Fitness, Career, Projects)
* Designed for *scale* from the start: hundreds of nodes without losing clarity
* Optimized for interaction with agents (e.g. visual distinction between human and AI-created goals)

You'll be able to:

* Visually explore and manipulate the goal tree
* View metadata like novelty, priority, or status at a glance
* Collapse, group, or focus on subtrees easily

## ðŸ¤– Agent Interaction Model

We define two primary stages of agent interaction:

### 1. **Goal Clarity Stage**

* You talk to an AI assistant to help untangle vague ideas
* The agent helps structure your goal into actionable subgoals
* Embeds the structured result into your tree, with clarity metadata

### 2. **Goal Progression Stage**

* Agents operate in the background, using your goal data to take action
* This could mean:

  * Researching resources
  * Generating documents/code/content
  * Suggesting next steps
  * Scheduling or coordinating
* They report progress back to you in a digestible way

This creates a human-AI feedback loop:

> You provide direction â†’ agent takes steps â†’ agent reports back â†’ you course correct or expand

## ðŸ¤© What's Next

* Integrate novelty/interestingness scores into the goal metadata
* Track agent vs human goal sources
* Design a "zoomed-out" dashboard view of all categories at once
* Build toward real-time agent execution and feedback loops
* Explore experimental frontends that adapt visual and atmospheric elements (e.g. backgrounds, themes, generated visuals) based on the goals being viewed or worked on

This isn't just a productivity tool. It's the interface between **you and your amplified self.**
