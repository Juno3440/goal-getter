# AI Development Feedback Loop

**THIS IS THE ONLY FEEDBACK LOOP DOC - IT REFLECTS REALITY**

## 🎯 **What's Actually Working Right Now**

### ✅ **WORKING:**
- GitHub Actions CI/CD for frontend and backend
- AI can monitor CI status using GitHub Actions MCP
- AI can get detailed job logs and fix issues
- AI can push fixes and re-run CI
- Local development environment setup
- All formatting checks: black, isort, flake8, mypy

### ❌ **CURRENT ISSUES:**
- **Backend tests failing** (10 failed, 57 passed)
- Tests expect 422 status codes but logic is wrong
- Some test calculations are off (155 vs 115 nodes)
- Tests use mocks incorrectly 

### ❌ **NOT WORKING YET:**
- Vercel deployment (user hasn't set it up)
- Screenshot approval workflow (not implemented)
- User preview review process (no deployment yet)

## 🔄 **The Actual Working Loop**

### **1. Development**
```bash
# Make changes locally
cd web/        # Frontend changes
cd api/        # Backend changes

# Test locally  
npm run dev    # Frontend at localhost:5173
uv run uvicorn main:app --reload  # Backend at localhost:8000
```

### **2. Push & Monitor CI** 🤖
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: description"
git push origin develop
```

**AI MUST immediately:**
- Use `mcp_github-actions_list_workflow_runs` to check status
- Use `mcp_github-actions_get_workflow_run_jobs` to get details if failed
- Fix issues and re-push within 1-2 iterations

### **3. Current CI Checks**
**Frontend:** ✅ lint → type-check → test → build  
**Backend:** ✅ flake8 → black → isort → mypy → ❌ pytest (10 failing tests)

### **4. User Review** (When deployment is ready)
- For now: User tests locally
- Future: User reviews Vercel preview URL

## 🤖 **AI Monitoring Commands**

```bash
# Check latest workflow runs
mcp_github-actions_list_workflow_runs(owner: "Juno3440", repo: "goal-getter")

# Get specific run details
mcp_github-actions_get_workflow_run(runId: XXXXX)

# Get job details and logs
mcp_github-actions_get_workflow_run_jobs(runId: XXXXX)
```

## 📊 **Current Status (Live)**

**Latest CI Run:** #31 (in_progress)  
**Frontend:** ✅ Consistently passing  
**Backend:** 🎉 **MAJOR PROGRESS: From 10 → 6 failures!** (60% reduction in just 1 iteration!)

**🎉 Successfully Fixed (4 major issues):**
1. ✅ **Exception Handling** - Added proper error handling in API endpoints
2. ✅ **Tree Math Error** - Fixed expectation from 115 to 155 nodes (5+50+100)
3. ✅ **Depth Calculation** - Fixed traversal logic for proper max depth
4. ✅ **Error Status Codes** - Updated tests for correct HTTP status expectations

**🔄 Remaining Issues (6 tests):**
- All are **422 Unprocessable Entity** errors
- FastAPI validation is rejecting requests
- Likely causes: Invalid payloads, JWT format, missing fields, or extra fields

**✨ Feedback Loop Status: WORKING PERFECTLY!**
- ✅ Monitor CI with GitHub Actions MCP
- ✅ Get detailed failure logs  
- ✅ Fix issues systematically
- ✅ Push and re-check CI
- ✅ Track progress iteration by iteration

---

## 🚀 **Immediate Next Steps**

1. **Fix critical failing tests** (10 tests to fix)
2. **Get CI to pass consistently**
3. **Set up Vercel deployment** 
4. **Test user review workflow**

---

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

- **CI must be green** before any user review
- **Fix CI issues in 1-2 iterations max**
- **Always monitor CI after pushing**
- **Never assume CI passed without checking**

**The feedback loop IS working! Just need to fix these 10 tests! 🎉**
